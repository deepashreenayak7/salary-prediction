# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict employee salaries based on years of experience. It demonstrates basic data analysis, visualization, and machine learning workflow using Python.

The project is ideal for beginners in **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning**, and showcases skills in Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains information about employees:
  - `YearsExperience` – Number of years of professional experience
  - `Salary` – Corresponding salary
- CSV File: `Salary_Data.csv`

---

## Key Features
- Data loading and preprocessing using **Pandas**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization using **Matplotlib**
- Linear Regression model for salary prediction using **Scikit-learn**
- Model evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**
